% BIBLIOGRAPHY TEMPLATE
% ========================================
% This file contains your paper's references in BibTeX format.
%
% Tips for managing references:
% 1. Use consistent citation keys (e.g., LastnameYear, or FirstauthorYear)
% 2. Get BibTeX entries from Google Scholar, DBLP, or conference websites
% 3. Consider using a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, etc.)
% 4. Claude Code can help you find and format citations!
%
% When working with Claude Code, you can ask:
% - "Find BibTeX citations for papers about [topic]"
% - "Add references for [paper title] to my bibliography"
% - "Format this reference in BibTeX"
% - "Search for recent papers on [topic] and add them"
