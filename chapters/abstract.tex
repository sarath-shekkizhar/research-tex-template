% ABSTRACT TEMPLATE
% ========================================
% Guidelines for writing a good abstract:
% 1. Start with the problem/motivation (1-2 sentences)
% 2. Introduce your approach/method (1-2 sentences)
% 3. Describe key technical contributions (1-2 sentences)
% 4. Present main results/findings (1-2 sentences)
% 5. Conclude with broader impact or significance (optional, 1 sentence)
%
% Keep it concise (typically 150-250 words for ML conferences)
% Avoid citations if possible
% Make it self-contained - readers should understand your contribution without reading the full paper

[Problem Statement] Start by describing the key problem or limitation in existing work that motivates your research. What gap are you addressing?

[Your Approach] Introduce your method or framework. Give it a clear name and briefly describe the key idea that makes it novel.

[Technical Contribution] Explain the main technical innovations or components of your approach. What makes it different from prior work?

[Experimental Results] Present your main quantitative results. Include key metrics and improvements over baselines. Be specific with numbers when possible.

[Broader Impact] Optionally, conclude with a sentence about the broader implications or potential applications of your work.
