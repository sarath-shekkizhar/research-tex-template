% ========================================
% IMPACT STATEMENT TEMPLATE
% ========================================
% Some conferences (like NeurIPS, ICML) require an impact statement discussing
% the broader societal implications of your work.
%
% Structure:
% - Positive impacts and potential applications
% - Potential negative consequences or risks
% - Ethical considerations
% - Mitigation strategies for identified risks
%
% Be thoughtful and honest. Avoid being overly promotional or dismissive of risks.

% You can remove this section if your target conference doesn't require it.

\label{sec:impact}

% Option 1: Minimal statement (if impacts are limited)
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of [your field]. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% Option 2: Detailed statement (use this structure if your work has significant societal implications)
% [Positive Impacts]
% This work aims to [primary goal], which has potential applications in [domains].
% The proposed approach could benefit [stakeholders] by [specific benefits].
% For example, [concrete positive application].

% [Potential Risks]
% However, like any [technology/method], our approach could potentially be misused for [negative applications].
% We acknowledge risks including [specific risk 1], [specific risk 2], and [specific risk 3].

% [Ethical Considerations]
% We have taken steps to address ethical concerns:
% - [Measure 1: e.g., evaluating for bias across demographic groups]
% - [Measure 2: e.g., implementing safeguards against misuse]
% - [Measure 3: e.g., ensuring data privacy and consent]

% [Data and Privacy Considerations]
% If your work involves human subjects data:
% Our study involved [number] participants recruited through [platform].
% We ensured ethical treatment by: [IRB approval if applicable], [informed consent], [fair compensation], [privacy protections].
% Participants were compensated [amount] for [time], which exceeds [relevant minimum wage].

% [Mitigation Strategies]
% To mitigate potential harms, we recommend:
% - [Specific recommendation 1]
% - [Specific recommendation 2]
% - [Release strategy: e.g., providing access through API with monitoring, releasing only evaluation code, etc.]

% [Broader Perspective]
% We believe this work [positive closing statement about advancing the field responsibly].
